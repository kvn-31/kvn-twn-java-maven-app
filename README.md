Based on [TWN - Java Maven App - Jenkins Files](https://gitlab.com/twn-devops-bootcamp/latest/08-jenkins/java-maven-app)

Used for Demo purposes

This repository contains setup using Jenkins that:

- Builds the app
- Creates a Docker image
- Pushes the Docker image to a private Docker registry

Have a look at the following branches:

- `master` & `develop` - were used to setup Freestyle & Pipeline Jobs
- `jenkins-shared-lib` - used to achieve the same setup using a Jenkins Shared Library
- `increment-app-version` - an extension which increments the app version on every build and commits the changes back to the repository
- `aws-deployment` - an extension which deploys the app on an AWS EC2 instance using ssh
- `aws-deployment-docker-compose` - deploys the app using Docker Compose; increments the app version on every build and commits the changes back to the repository
- `terraform` - adds Terraform to the pipeline to provision a remote server within CI/CD
- `deploy-on-k8s` - deploys nginx (for testing purposes) to a k8s cluster in the deploy step
- `build-and-deploy-k8s` - builds the app and deploys it to a k8s cluster
- `build-and-deploy-k8s-ecr` - same as above, but uses ECR instead of Docker Hub
- `feature/ansible` - In this Project Jenkins will copy Ansible files to a remote Droplet and execute them to create setup docker compose.
