Based on [TWN - Java Maven App - Jenkins Files](https://gitlab.com/twn-devops-bootcamp/latest/08-jenkins/java-maven-app)

This repository contains a simple Java Maven App with a Jenkinsfile that:
- Builds the app
- Creates a Docker image
- Pushes the Docker image to a private Docker registry

In this project the App version is incremented automatically by the Jenkins pipeline.
